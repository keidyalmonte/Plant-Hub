# Plant-Hub

The Plant Hub is an educational plant monitoring system engineered to facilitate a hands-on academic experience between a student and a supervising educator.
The goal is to aspire and cultivate innovative and productive learning spaces within a K-12 environment in order to form good habits and teach children about
responsibility without the hazards that come with owning a high-maintenance plant. 

The Plant Hub is a smart planter that keeps track of ambient temperature, humidity, light levels, and soil moisture. These levels will be displayed to the student
via an LCD display for their analysis facilitated by an educator. The students will then grow their plants from seeds with their unique care instructions and keep
track of its environmental and physical characteristics. As the plants grow and students collect more and more data, the educator can display overall trends among
the class to facilitate discussions about basic data analysis and the best environment for the plants. The versatility of The Plant Hub should, however, empower 
educators to propose their own experiments to further educate their students and create unconventional learning experiences.

The inspiration for the Plant Hub came from acknowledging my lack of plant knowledge and therefore, lack of sufficient care for my own plants. I hope to encourage
others to be motivated in research and develop techniques in which they feel most comfortable in taking care of plant specimens.
